== General info
_<Here you describe the duties of this on-call and relevant information. For example, if you are watching a migration process from a cluster in region A to region B, you may want to have that information in this section.>_


== Runbooks
_<This section will contain code. The runbooks that the person on duty might need, with a short and clear description of what it solves or does. Think that the person on duty will have to operate fast, so the information should not have a complex structure>_

== Known workarounds
_<Here, as well, code. For those "know issues" and which you have a workaround in case they happen.>_


== Observability
_<Here you will have, in bullet points, the list of links to the relevant observability>_

* Service A
** link:http://whatever[Dashboard of <Service A>]
** link:http://whatever[Logs <Service A>]
* link:http://whatever[Kafka topic list in region eu-west-3]


== Logs
_<Here the person in duty will record the log of the session. By date, will create an entry (as bullet points) with a sort description. Really important in case there is an issue during the session, it's important to get it recorded. See the example>_
